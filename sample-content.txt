This is a sample article for testing the CrawlRegistry system.

# Blockchain and Permanent Storage

Blockchain technology provides a decentralized way to store and verify information. 
When combined with permanent storage solutions like Irys (formerly Arweave), it creates 
a powerful system for preserving digital content.

## Benefits

1. **Immutability**: Once stored, content cannot be altered
2. **Permanence**: Content remains accessible indefinitely
3. **Verifiability**: Content can be cryptographically verified
4. **Ownership**: Clear record of content ownership through NFTs

## Use Cases

- Archiving important documents
- Preserving news articles
- Storing scientific research
- Creating permanent records of creative works

This sample content will be uploaded to Irys and registered in the CrawlRegistry contract 
as an NFT, demonstrating the full workflow of the system.
